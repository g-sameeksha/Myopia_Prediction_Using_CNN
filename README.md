# Myopia Image Classification using CNN
*Deep learning model to classify retinal images as Normal or Myopia*

---

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **deep learning model** that classifies **retinal images** into two categories:

* **Normal**
* **Myopia**

We use a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras to automatically detect the presence of myopia from retinal images. This work demonstrates how computer vision can assist in **early detection of eye conditions** and support healthcare professionals.
